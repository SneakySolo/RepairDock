q2. how do I actually know that it's an entity or not ?
q3. (task 12) RepairShop → User relationship + ownership clarity. what is going on ?
q4. while making the request entityy and havig @manytoone relation, how did we decide that what will be join column name and stuff
q5. some places I have put @one to many but not on other entity, but reverse in some others. WHY ?
q6. why (fetch = FetchType.LAZY) on media relation ??
q7. how could I have had done task 16 on my own ?
q8. why create separate repo for media and request?
q9. diff bw @notempty and @notblank
q10. under the createRequest in service layer, why first user then req then media. ALso why loop for media ?
q11. see that we put @manytoone on request and repairshop in bid entity but join column using (name = "request_id") as that name isn't even on request entity.
q12. how I can make bidservice without any help, I was confused on how to get request things while being on big side.....
q13. why reqmapping on top of class in repaircontroller ??


most importantly - how do i decide the structure of a project ?
